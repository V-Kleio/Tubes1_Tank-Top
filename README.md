<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project showcases four distinct bots developed for **Robocode Tank Royale** version 0.30, each implementing different **greedy algorithms** to optimize their combat strategies. The bots—**PNIS Bot, ASSBot, ASUBot, and Obi-Wan Tanknobi**—demonstrate various approaches to movement, targeting, and decision-making in a competitive environment.

## Bots Overview
- **PNIS Bot**: Uses **predictive aiming** and **adaptive movement** to efficiently track and engage enemies, balancing offensive and defensive strategies.  
- **ASSBot**: Employs a highly **aggressive targeting system**, prioritizing nearby low-energy enemies for high-damage attacks.  
- **ASUBot**: Implements a **stealth-based approach**, utilizing a **danger map** to navigate the battlefield and avoid high-risk zones.  
- **Obi-Wan Tanknobi**: Focuses on **high-ground dominance**, leveraging positional advantage while reacting quickly to enemy energy changes.
